# adventOfCode2023
My solutions to some of the advent of code challenges created by Eric Wastl (https://adventofcode.com/2023/).

This is my first Rust code so I played around a little and I want to solve the upcoming puzzle with Rust as well.

Day one, two and three have been solved by using Swift (not refactored at all :D).
